        <p class="referenceTo">Dear Jason,</p>
        <p>
            I&apos;m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative, effective August 14, 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&apos;ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in early September. 
            I&apos;m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible to you during the transition.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&apos;ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our team at LMK. 
            It&apos;s rare to find a customer service role that offers as much opportunity to grow and learn, as well as such a positive, 
            inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&apos;m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please let me know if there&apos;s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.
        </p>
        <p class="referenceFrom">Thanks, and best wishes,<br/><br/>
